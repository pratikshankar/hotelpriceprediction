# hotelpriceprediction
This repository contains a regression model used to predict the hotel prices.
Here I have used catboost regressor model to predict the amount a person will spend ..
I have implemented some data cleaning processes and have used feature engineering to derive some new features that hepled me to predict more accurately.
I have uploaded the dataset as well.
